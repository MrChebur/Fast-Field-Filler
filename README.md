# Fast-Field-Filler
 
The plugin was created to quickly fill in the fields in the attribute table.

The plugin allows you to quickly select the desired vector objects with the mouse, specify the desired field and quickly fill in the desired field of all objects in the pre-prepared list. For example, this plugin may be useful if you classify thermal spots detected by remote sensing data and divide all objects into: fires, anthropogenic heat sources, false alarms.

# Plugin features:
- Save and load the values you need in a Json format file.
- Assign hotkeys to quickly fill the attribute table with the desired values.
- Set a limit on the maximum selection of objects ( to avoid accidentally overwriting everything).
- Buttons to save results and rollback changes.
